BUGS
Keeps track of any bugs found in the program files

Bugs and line numbers:
-Initially the head pointer is not initialized to anything so it cannot be used
-My solution was to set it equal to NULL

-In function list_insert2(line 24) the nodes need to be pointers rather than actual nodes
-This causes it to not free memory at the end
-My solution was to make it the same style as list_insert

-In function list_remove (line 39) the function doesn't actually move a node into the new spot, it only changes where the pointer is in the list
-It also jumps to an uninitialized part of the list
-This leads to no removal of a node and only continues to move throygh the list
-My solution was to rewrite the function so that it frees the node at that point and then move another node into its place

-In function list_destroy the function only frees the head node and leaves the rest of the pointers dangling
-This creates a memory leak that is unable to be fixed
-My solution was to rewrite the function and free each node in the list to ensure there is no leftover memory used
